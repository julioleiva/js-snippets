// Aliasing destructured variables

/* But, what if we want to alias the variables to something else? For example, we want to alias the name variable to fullName and the age variable to userAge.
Hereâ€™s what we can do */

const User = {
    name: 'John Doe',
    age: 30
};

const { name: fullName, age: userAge } = User;

console.log(fullName); // John Doe
console.log(userAge); // 30


/*As you can tell, we can alias the variables by using the : operator. So, we can alias the name variable to fullName and the age variable to userAge.*/
